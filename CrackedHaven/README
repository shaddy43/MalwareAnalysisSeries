This repo explains the process of software cracking and how they can be backdoored. The report explains the signifance of avoiding the use of cracked software.

Along with the report, a cracked version of a binary is also included for Photoshop CS6. To use it, simply rename the file to amtlib.dll and replace it in the photoshop cs6 directory.

However, this is for educational purposes only. That is why, in the cracked i have included a "You are hacked!!!" messagebox for awareness.
