This repo explains the process of **software cracking** and how they can be backdoored. The purpose of this exercise if to signify the danger of using the cracked software.

The repository contains a PDF report showcasing the whole process of software cracking performed on **Adobe Photoshop CS6**. Along with the report, a cracked version of a binary is also included. To use it, simply rename the file to **amtlib.dll** and replace it in the photoshop cs6 directory.

### Cracked & Backdoored

The above GIF shows how the cracked Adobe Photoshop CS6 when opened, spawns a MessageBox saying **"You are Hacked!!!"**. If a simple message can be poped up when the software is opened then imagine what a real hacker could do in such software?

To put it simply, the use of cracked software is basically inviting hackers to get inside your systems and do all kinds of malicious activities.

I have included my version of cracked binary in the folder of **tools_and_scripts**. The password for rar is also available in same folder.
