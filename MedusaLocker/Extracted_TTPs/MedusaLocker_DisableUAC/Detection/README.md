This TTP is used to disable UAC in the victim system and has been extracted from MedusaLocker Ransomware. It modifies registry keys to disable UAC. It requires **Admin privileges** and **Restart** to completely disable the UAC on the system. Once the testcase has successfully been executed, every process will open as admin by default.

#### Detection Indicators
The detection indicators in the UAC bypass TTP of MedusaLocker Ransomware are:
- Registry Key: "SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System"
- Registry Value Name: "EnableLUA"
- Registry Value Data: 0

### Log Sources
I have configured multiple log sources in my detection lab. I am using **Azure Sentinel** as my SIEM solution. The following logs are injested into SIEM:
- Microsoft Defender XDR logs
- Windows Security Audit logs
- Sysmon Logs with sysmon-moduler configuration

### Detection Engineering with Defender XDR
The following query is looking for registry events and filtering the data based on registry key **"SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System"**, which is used to bypass UAC in medusa locker ransomware. This key could be used to enable or disable UAC on the system. If the value of **EnableLUA** entity is set to 0 then after restart every process will start as admin by default.

```kql
DeviceRegistryEvents
| where RegistryKey contains "SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System"
| project TimeGenerated, RegistryKey, RegistryValueName, RegistryValueData, PreviousRegistryKey, InitiatingProcessFileName
| where RegistryValueData contains "0"
```

### Detection Engineering with Sysmon
The logic of query is similar in Sysmon logs. The EventIDs related to registry changes are 12, 13, 14. I am looking for registry related events that have the object containing **"SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System"**. In sysmon logs, the configuration that i am using also provides MITRE mapping and could be seen in the results.

```kql
WindowsEvent //(sysmon)
| where EventID in (12, 13, 14)
| where EventData contains "SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System"
| project TimeGenerated, Computer, EventID, EventType = EventData.EventType, Image = EventData.Image, RuleName = EventData.RuleName, TargetObject = EventData.TargetObject
```
