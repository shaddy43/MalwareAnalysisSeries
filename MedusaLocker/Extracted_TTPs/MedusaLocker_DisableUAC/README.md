This TTP is used to disable UAC in the victim system and has been extracted from MedusaLocker Ransomware. It modifies registry keys to disable UAC. It requires **Admin privileges** and **Restart** to completely disable the UAC on the system. Once the testcase has successfully been executed, every process will open as admin by default.
