This is the encryptor TTP extracted from MedusaLocker Ransomware. It uses a combination of AES and RSA keys for encrypting files. The ransomware first initializes the encryptor by setting encryption libraries and cryptographic context. It creates a random AES session key and encrypt it with the embedded attacker’s public key. It saves the encrypted AES key in the RansomNote first as a UNIQUE ID, and then launches the encryptor on whole system.


#### Detection Indicators
The detection indicators i found in MedusaLocker Encrypter are:
- RansomNote file creation with name: **"how_to_back_files.html"**
- Sensitive File Read Operations (.docx, .pdf, .xlsx, etc)

### Log Sources
I have configured multiple log sources in my detection lab. I am using **Azure Sentinel** as my SIEM solution. The following logs are injested into SIEM:
- Microsoft Defender XDR logs
- Windows Security Audit logs
- Sysmon Logs with sysmon-moduler configuration

### Detection Engineering with Defender XDR
In the encrypter TTP, I am correlating two different type of events based on Microsoft XDR logs. The first are file create events, in which i am looking for the **ransom note**. The second type of events are **SensitiveFileRead** events, which is logged whenever a computer program tries to open or get handle of specific extension files (eg .docx, .pdf, .xlsx, .pnpt etc). In the following query, I am **correlating** ransom note creation events with the sensitive file read events based on the **Process** that is responsible for both these events in any computer system.

```kql
let ransomnote_create_events = DeviceFileEvents
    | where FileName contains 'how_to_back_files.html'
    | project TimeGenerated, DeviceName, RansomNote = FileName, RansomNotePath = FolderPath, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessParentFileName;
let sensitive_file_read_events = DeviceEvents
    | where ActionType in ('SensitiveFileRead')
    | project TimeGenerated, DeviceName, SensitiveFileRead = FileName, SensitiveFileReadFolder = FolderPath, InitiatingProcessFileName;
ransomnote_create_events
    | join kind=innerunique (sensitive_file_read_events) on DeviceName, InitiatingProcessFileName
    | project TimeGenerated, DeviceName, RansomNote, RansomNotePath, SensitiveFileRead, SensitiveFileReadFolder, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessParentFileName;
```
