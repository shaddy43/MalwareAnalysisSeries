This is the encryptor TTP extracted from MedusaLocker Ransomware. It uses a combination of AES and RSA keys for encrypting files. The ransomware first initializes the encryptor by setting encryption libraries and context. It creates a random AES session key and encrypt it with the embedded attacker's public key. It saves the encrypted AES key in the RansomNote first as a UNIQUE ID, and then launches the encryptor on whole system.

- The ransom note available in the malware is of actual attacker's but modified to hide the contact of attacker
- The encryptor is set in a way that it will encrypt all (allowed extension) files in the Pictures folder
- Actual attacker's public key is being used, so remove anything important from the Pictures folder first before executing the malware
