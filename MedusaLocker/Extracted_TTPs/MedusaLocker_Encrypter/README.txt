This is the encryptor TTP extracted from MedusaLocker Ransomware. It uses a combination of AES and RSA keys for encrypting files. The ransomware first initializes the encryptor by setting encryption libraries and context. It creates a random AES session key and encrypt it with the embedded attacker's public key. It saves the encrypted AES key in the RansomNote first as a UNIQUE ID, and then launches the encryptor on whole system.

1. The ransom note available in the malware is of actual attacker's but modified to hide the contact of attacker
2. The encryptor is set in a way that it will encrypt all (allowed extension) files in the Pictures folder
3. Actual attacker's public key is being used, so remove anything important from the Pictures folder first before executing the malware
