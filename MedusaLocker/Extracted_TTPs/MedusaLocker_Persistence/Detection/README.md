### MedusaLocker

MedusaLocker uses a different way of achieving persistence. It uses official Microsoft Documented Code for achieving persistence by scheduling a task with repetition of 15 minutes indefinitely. Typically, malware uses either **at.exe** or **schtasks.exe** which are Windows apps for scheduling tasks, but in this case the malware scheduled task programmatically in c/c++ using official code from MSDN page of Microsoft.

The malware creates a copy of itself with the name of “svhost.exe” in %APPDATA% of the system and registers itself in task scheduler to be executed after every 15 minutes indefinitely.

#### Detection Indicators
The detection indicators that seems interesting to me in the persistence TTP of MedusaLocker Ransomware are:
1	Task name: svhost
2	Task repitition trigger: 15 minutes indefinitely
3	Task command: '\AppData\Roaming\svhost.exe'

### Log Sources
I have configured multiple log sources in my detection lab. I am using Azure Sentinel as my SIEM solution. The following logs are injested into SIEM:
1	Microsoft Defender XDR logs
2	Windows Security Audit logs
3	Sysmon Logs with sysmon-moduler configuration

### Detection Engineering with Defender XDR
The following query is looking for newly created scheduled tasks that contains a task name either **medusa** (used in my code) or **svhost** (used in actual malware). The second condition is looking for the keywords of **PT15M** (Trigger) and **AppData\Roaming\svhost** (command).

```kql
DeviceEvents
| where ActionType == "ScheduledTaskCreated" and AdditionalFields.TaskName has_any ('Medusa', 'svhost') or (AdditionalFields.TaskContent contains "PT15M" and AdditionalFields.TaskContent contains "svhost")
```

### Detection Engineering with Security Audit logs
In the Security Audit Logs, most of the data is logged as RAW xml in EventData column. The event id for task scheduling is **4698**. So for detecting in Audit logs, only search target keywords in EventData column.

```kql
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4698 and EventData has_all ('svhost', 'medusa', 'PT15M')
```

### Detection Engineering with Sysmon
In sysmon logs, there is no EventID that directly records Task scheduling, but there are other ways of detecting malicious tasks using the Event ID of FileCreate which is **11**. The registered tasks create a file in the **system32\Tasks** folder. Along with this, the svhost file that is created in %AppData% could also be detected with the file created events. 
Note: I have included the name medusa beacuse my code creates the task with this name instead of svhost (used by malware)

```kql
Sysmon
| where EventID == 11 and EventData.TargetFilename has_any ('medusa', 'svhost')
```
