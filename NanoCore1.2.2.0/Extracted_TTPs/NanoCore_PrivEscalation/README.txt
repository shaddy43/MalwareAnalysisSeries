This is a privilege escalation TTP extracted from NanoCore 1.2.2.0. It uses task scheduler to escalate privileges. Initially the NanoCore client is executed with admin privileges, and it creates a task in scheduler with admin configuration. Once the task has been added, the NanoCore client can easily regain admin privileges even after reboot by simply executing a Run task command.

1. Execute with admin privileges first
2. Can elevate privileges anytime by running the command: schtasks.exe /run /tn "NTFS Manager"
3. "NTFS Manager" is the name of malicious task masquerading legitimate windows operations (in nanocore these names are randomized)
4. "GetUACControlData" returns the task configuration in bytes
