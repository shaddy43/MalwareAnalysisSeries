Welcome to the MalwareAnalysisSeries repository, your go-to destination for highly refined analysis reports, useful reverse engineering tools & scripts, unpacked malware stages, extracted TTPs and its development. This open-source pet project is dedicated to dissecting infamous malware families, offering deep technical insights assisting in advance analysis and reverse engineering. The process of malware development is also covered in this repository as each significant TTP is recreated in exact way as the actual malware.

## Purpose
The primary goal of MalwareAnalysisSeries is to provide a comprehensive resource for cybersecurity enthusiasts, researchers, and professionals alike. By delving into the intricate workings of prominent malware families, my aim is to empower the community with invaluable knowledge and tools to enhance their understanding of cybersecurity threats and bolster defense mechanisms.

### [Github Repo](https://github.com/shaddy43/MalwareAnalysisSeries)
- The Reports are available in the root directory of each malware folder
- The Samples and unpacked stages are available in subfolder "sample" in each malware folder
- The helping tools are available in subfolder "tools_and_scripts" in each malware folder
- The extracted TTPs are separate mini projects, each can be found in the subfolder "Extracted_TTPs" of every malware root folder
- The Images,Videos,GIFs or any other helping material can be found in the subfolder "Assets" in each TTP folder
