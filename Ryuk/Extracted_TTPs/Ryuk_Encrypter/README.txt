This is the emulation of infamous RYUK ransomware encryptor. It uses same behavior, set of API calls and technique to encrypt files on the victim system. Every single file is encrypted with a different AES session key and appended as "file meta" at the end of encrypted file. In the meta the AES session key is appended after it is encrypted with Attacker's public key. The keyword "HERMES" is the indicator of meta.

To test the malware:
1) Create dummy files in path "c:\users\public\RyukTesting" or simply run the createFiles.ps1 powershell script included in repo (It automatically createst this directory in public and write dummy files)
2) Run the compiled binary
3) Check the encrypted file meta at the end of each file

Note: Extension is not changed as per RYUK behavior
