This analysis report provides a detailed examination of the Ryuk ransomware, a sophisticated threat leveraging a potent combination of a high-speed multi-threaded encryptor, AES, and RSA encryption algorithms. Ryuk employs advanced techniques such as process injection, significantly increasing the speed of infection by exploiting a multitude of processes concurrently.

In this repo, the original sample of Ryuk is provided along with its extracted Stage2 sample. A third sample is also provided **(stage2_injector_defanged.rar)** which is patched to avoid injecting in other processes. 
The password is **"infected"** for all archieves.

A list of extraced API's are provide in the API_list text file in directory "tools_and_scripts".
