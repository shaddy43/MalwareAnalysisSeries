This is a memory patch TTP extracted from Xloader4.3. The xloader AKA formbook, hides its core malicious functionality under the guise of encrypted code malicious functions that are patched at run-time in the memory during its exectution. This POC aims to recreate a simplified version of xloader memory patching ttp by finding encrypted signature bytes and decrypt and execute those bytes.

The screenshot explains the simple process of patching and including encrypted bytes to the binary for delivery.
To understand the process easily, just execute the compiled binary in cmdline and map the printed details in memory...!
