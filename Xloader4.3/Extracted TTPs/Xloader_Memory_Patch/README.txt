This is a memory patch TTP extracted from Xloader4.3. The xloader AKA formbook, hides its core malicious functionality under the guise of encrypted core malicious functions that are patched at run-time in the memory during its exectution. This POC aims to recreate a simplified version of xloader memory patching ttp by finding encrypted signature bytes, then decrypt and execute those bytes.

The screenshot explains the simple process of preparing the binary (payload) by patching encrypted bytes to its text section for delivery.
To understand the process easily, just execute the compiled binary (available in release directory) in cmdline and map the printed details in memory...!!!
